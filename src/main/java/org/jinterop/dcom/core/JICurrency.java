/**Definition from MSDN: <i> encapsulates the CURRENCY data type used in Automation. CURRENCY is implemented 
 * as an 8-byte, two's-complement integer value scaled by 10,000. This gives a fixed-point number 
 * with 15 digits to the left of the decimal point and 4 digits to the right. The CURRENCY data type
 * is extremely useful for calculations involving money, or for any fixed-point calculation where accuracy 
 * is important. It is one of the possible types for the VARIANT data type of Automation.<p>
 *
 * for example :- <br>
 * If the absolute value of the fractional part is greater than 10,000, the appropriate adjustment 
 * is made to the units, as shown in the third of the following examples. <p>
 *
 * Note that the units and fractional part are specified by signed long values. The fourth of the following  
 * examples shows what happens when the parameters have different signs. <p>
 * 
 * COleCurrency curA;           // value: 0.0000 <br>
 * curA.SetCurrency(4, 500);    // value: 4.0500 <br>
 * curA.SetCurrency(2, 11000);  // value: 3.1000 <br>
 * curA.SetCurrency(2, -50);    // value: 1.9950 <br>
